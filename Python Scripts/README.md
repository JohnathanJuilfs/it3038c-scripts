If you are using regular Python, run this command to ensure you have PIP
installed. py -m pip --version. If you do not have pip installed, then
you have to download the file get-pip.py which you can find anywhere on
the internet. then open cmd.exe and type: python get-pip.py If you are
using Pycharm, you can just click settings under your Python project and
click on your project, then click the little + symbol and search pip. To
install Pillow with regular Python, input these commands into your
script: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip python3 -m pip install
--upgrade Pillow If you are using Pycharm, use the same method as before
but search for Pillow and click add.
Then download Lab7.py from my github, as well as fox.jpg and make sure they are in the same folder so the script can access the image.
Then you can open up my script and
run it and it will display three edited images using Pillow.
