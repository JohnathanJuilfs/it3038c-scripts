Included in this repository are two seperate Python project ideas that I
found interesting to research and code. In order to run the
RandomPasswordGenerator.py, download the file and open it up in your
Python, then run the script and the output will be one password that is
15 characters long with special characters included, and uppercase and
lowercase letters as well. In order to run the RockPaperScissors.py,
download the file and open it up in your Python, then run the code and
you will prompted to enter a move by typing in your terminal. The moves
you can enter are "Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors". If you enter anything
other than those 3 exact strings (including the capitalized first
letter) you will get an error and it wil prompt you to re-enter your
move correctly. After you enter your move correctly you will either win,
lose, or tie against the computer, just like in real rock paper
scissors.
